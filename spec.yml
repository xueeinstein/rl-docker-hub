    # THIS IS A GENERATED DOCKERFILE.
    #
    # This file was assembled from multiple pieces, whose use is documented
    # throughout. Please refer to the github:xueeinstein/rl-docker-hub
    # for more information.

# A combinatorial explosion of Docker images and Dockerfiles.
# Each "release" defines all of the ways to combine related but separate chunks
# of functionality ("slices") by listing all of the "slice sets" to use when
# building.
#
# For example, a release that uses {ubuntu}{py} would create 4 Dockerfiles
# (which could become images or concrete Dockerfiles), because the "ubuntu"
# and "py" slice sets both have two entries:
#
#   - cpu (no -py2 because the Python 2 slice set has add_to_name: ""
#   - cpu-py3
#   - gpu (similar)
#   - gpu-py3
#
# Releases are all treated differently by TensorFlow's CI systems.
